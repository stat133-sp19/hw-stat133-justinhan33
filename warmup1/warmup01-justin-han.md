***Baked Buffalo Wings***

![*Great for all occasion!*](https://smittenkitchendotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/oven-baked-buffalo-wings.jpg?w=1500)

**Ingredients**

-   1 to 4 pounds chicken wings that have been cut into flats and drumettes
-   1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (per pound of wings)
-   1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (per pound of wings)
-   2 tablespoons hot sauce (per pound of wings)
-   1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (per pound of wings)

 

**"Special" Kitchen Tools**

-   Oven-safe cooling rack
-   Large baking sheet with foil
-   Nonstick spray
-   Paper towels
-   Large bowl
-   Tongs or spatula
-   Medium saucepan
-   Whisk

 

**Steps**

1.  Line a large baking sheet with foil and set an oven-safe cooling rack on top (optional: coat with nonstick spray)
2.  Pat wings dry with a paper towel
3.  In a large bowl, toss wings with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of wings, until thoroughly coated
4.  Arrange wings on the rack with some space between them and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours
5.  Heat oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of oven
6.  Bake wings for 20 minutes, flip them with tongs or a spatula and bake for another 15 minutes, flip them back over again, and bake for 15 final minutes (total baking time: 50 minutes)
7.  While wings are in the oven, make Buffalo wing sauce. In a medium saucepan, for each pound of wings, mix 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons to 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine
8.  When wings are done, roll each in prepared Buffalo wing sauce
9.  Serve and Enjoy

[Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
======================================================================

$\\LARGE\\text{Definition}$ \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_distance&action=edit&section=1)\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment) connecting them ($\\overline{\\textbf{pq}}$).  

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in [Euclidean *n*-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

 *d*(**p**, **q**)= *d*(**q**, **p**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+\\dots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$  

$\\hspace{63pt}$ = $\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i-p\_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

 ||**p**|| = $\\sqrt{(p\_1^2+p\_2^2+\\dots+p\_n^2)}$ = $\\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\bullet \\textbf{q}}$,

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
